# median_filter

### Goal

Our goal is to perform a median filter on a series of images.

### Basic Steps

The basic steps are as follows (your solution may vary):

• Load images as a list of picture objects

• Create a new empty image of the appropriate width and height.

• For each pixel, store the red, green, and blue values of the 9 images.

– Calculate the median for each of these lists and use the median value to set new
pixel values for the new image.
